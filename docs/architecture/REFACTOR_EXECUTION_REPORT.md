## 5. Phase-by-Phase Detail

### Phase A — Bootstrap fix (critical)
- Created `bootstrap/cache/`, `storage/app/public/`, `storage/framework/{cache,sessions,views,testing}/`, `storage/logs/`.
- Without this, NO artisan command works.
- `php artisan optimize:clear` now green.

### Phase B — Structural support layer
- 8 enums for status/role/feature keys (replaces ad-hoc string literals).
- `FormatHelper` consolidates currency/date/badge formatting.

### Phase C — Authorization expansion
- 3 new policies: `CompanyPolicy`, `CmsPolicy`, `DocumentationPolicy`.
- Auto-discovered by Laravel 11 (no provider registration needed).
- Existing policies unchanged.

### Phase D — Service layer expansion
- `RoleRequestService` — encapsulates approve/reject/cancel with audit log + Spatie role sync.
- `PremiumAccessService` — feature lock check with cache + subscription gate; bypass for superadmin/admin_platform.
- `EventFinanceService` — recompute finance summary from transactions (used by EventFinanceController when present; safe to call).

### Phase E — Cron infrastructure (Vercel adaptation)
- `VerifyCronToken` middleware: `hash_equals` constant-time compare; reads `?token=` or `Authorization: Bearer`.
- `CronController`: calls `Artisan::call('schedule:run')`, returns JSON with output.
- Route `/api/cron/scheduler` registered last (after all web groups).
- `vercel.json` `crons` block: `* * * * *` schedule.

### Phase F — Vercel build pipeline
- Single `buildCommand` runs composer install (no-dev), npm ci + build, then artisan discover + cache commands.
- `view:cache`, `config:cache`, `route:cache` reduce cold-start latency.
- `.vercelignore` excludes dev artifacts and storage subdirs that are rebuilt at runtime.

### Phase G — Env documentation
- `.env.example` updated with all new keys (AWS/R2, CRON_SECRET, SESSION/CACHE/QUEUE=database).

### Phase H — Validation
- `php artisan route:list` — 427 routes, 0 errors.
- `php artisan test` — 149/149 passing.
- `npm run build` — green.
- `php artisan migrate:status` — all green.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations Applied

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| New enum usage in existing controllers may break | **Enums are isolated**; no existing controller code was refactored to use them. They are available for future use. |
| `CompanyPolicy` may conflict with existing controller logic | **Policies are opt-in.** Controllers must call `Gate::authorize()` to use them. None was changed. Safe addition. |
| `CronController` exposing `Artisan::call` | **Token middleware is enforced** at the route level; without valid `CRON_SECRET`, request returns 403/503. |
| Vercel cron path with `?token=` in plain text | Vercel stores `CRON_SECRET` as project env; URL is constructed by Vercel at deploy. Alternative: read from `Authorization: Bearer` header. |
| `composer install --no-dev` removes phpunit on production | Tests are not run in production build. Fine. |
| `php artisan route:cache` cache stale during development | `optimize:clear` clears all caches. Cached only at Vercel build. |

## 7. Outstanding Phase 2 Items (Not Done in This Refactor)

- [ ] Use `RoleEnum`/`StatusEnum` in controllers (deprecation of string literals).
- [ ] Use `PremiumAccessService` in feature-gated views (e.g. analytics page).
- [ ] Use `EventFinanceService` in `EventFinanceController`.
- [ ] Use `RoleRequestService` in `RoleRequestController` (both member + superadmin).
- [ ] Consolidate middleware: remove `EnsureActiveUser.php` + `EnsureUserIsActive.php` duplicates.
- [ ] Add `Tests\Feature\CronRouteTest` (token protection).
- [ ] Add `Tests\Feature\CompanyPolicyTest`.
- [ ] Add fulltext index on events/communities for public search.
- [ ] Add `.gitkeep` to `public/build/` (so empty dir committed) or include build in deploy.
- [ ] Add CSP/X-Frame-Options headers.
- [ ] Implement email queue (Phase 2).
- [ ] Add rate limiting on login (Phase 2).
- [ ] Add 2FA (Phase 2).

## 8. Rollback

If refactor causes production issues:
```bash
git checkout main       # or pre-refactor branch
vercel env pull         # restore env from Vercel
git push origin main    # Vercel auto-redeploys
```

DB is unchanged. No migration was added/modified. Code changes are isolated to new files + 5 file modifications.
